## Assignment

### Approach & Implementation

•	The MVVM architecture, SOLID Principle and protocol-oriented programming design has been used to complete the assignment.

•	The code follows the BDD approach which is being implemented using 3rd party frameworks, Quick and Nimble, based on XCTest. The code is scalable, testable and flexible.

•	The user-defaults have been used to persist the data. Although, CoreData/iCloud can be used to make it scalable but considering the scope of the assignment, I restricted it to user defaults.

•	The native API has been used in the all the possible cases, to avoid the incompatibility with iOS versions and to make the software flexible enough like NSCache, URLSession etc.

•	The app is universal.

•	App is designed using storyboard.

•	App targets iOS 9.0 & above.

•	Handled all error scenarios.

### Assumptions

•	The basic UI has been used to depict the behavior and the assignment. The UI can be modified and improved further but not considered as a part of this assignment.

### Tests & Static Analysis

•	Coverage is more than 90% and 38 test cases.

•	Zero warnings
